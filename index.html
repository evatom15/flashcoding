    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>The Branford Price Millar Library was built in two parts. The first part was completed in 1968. The architects, Skidmore, Ownings, and Merril built it in a brutalist style to contrast with the existing natural landscape. The second part was completed in 1991. This part of the library was built in a convex form to fit around the historic copper beech tree that still stands in front of the library today. This tree was planted circa 1892 by the industrialist Watson family, who used to live on Park and Hall (“Millar Library”). The house owned by the Watson family was torn down to build the library, but they left the tree. The story is often told that PSU students protested the tearing down of the tree in the 1980s, resulting in the building plans being changed to accommodate it. However, it is more likely that a tree company named it as an asset to the University, which led them to decide to keep it. When making the original plans for the new addition, the architects and others involved in the process agreed it was important to the campus (Rojas).

    <h2>Library Catalogue History</h2>
    <p>Portland State University’s library used to be in Smith Memorial Student Union when it was still Portland State College. When the first part of Branford Price Millar Library was built it was called Library West, while the old library was known as Library East. Eventually as Smith Memorial Student Union grew, the library moved entirely out of the building and into the newer building, but it was not completely moved until 2013. The library was named after Branford Price Millar, who was Portland State University’s former president from 1959-1968 (“Millar Library”). </p>
